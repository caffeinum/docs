title: 'Connect Wallet'
description: 'Hook up your wallet to our experimental chain'
---

## The Easy Way

Just click this magic link (works with most wallets):
```
https://chainid.link/?chainId=80418041&chainName=mo.ai&currencyName=ETH&currencySymbol=ETH&currencyDecimals=18&rpcUrl=https://rpc.moai.ltd&blockExplorerUrl=http://explorer.moai.cash
```

## The Manual Way (if you like pain)

Any EVM wallet should work (we've tested with):
- MetaMask
- WalletConnect
- Others probably work too, but YMMV ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### MetaMask Setup

1. Hit that "Add Network" button
2. Choose "Add Network Manually" (because we're hackers)
3. Here's the secret sauce:

```bash
Network Name: mo.ai    # yes, that's really the name
RPC URL: https://rpc.moai.ltd
Chain ID: 80418041     # we picked a fun number
Currency: ETH          # keeping it simple
Block Explorer: http://explorer.moai.cash
```

## For the Code Warriors

Using ethers.js (the cool way):
```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Connect to our experimental chain
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.moai.ltd');
const signer = provider.getSigner();

// Make sure you're in the right place
const network = await provider.getNetwork();
console.log('Connected to the experiment:', network.name);
```

Using web3.js (the classic way):
```javascript
import Web3 from 'web3';

const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.moai.ltd');

// Trust but verify
const chainId = await web3.eth.getChainId();
console.log('If you see 80418041, you\'re in the right place!');
```

## Troubleshooting

If something breaks (and it might):
1. Double-check the chain ID (80418041 - memorize it!)
2. Make sure you have some ETH (it's test ETH, but we still need it)
3. If all else fails, join our Discord and let's figure it out together!
