## The Easy Way

Just click this [magic link](https://chainid.link/?chainId=80418041&chainName=mo.ai&currencyName=ETH&currencySymbol=ETH&currencyDecimals=18&rpcUrl=https://rpc.moai.ltd&blockExplorerUrl=http://explorer.moai.cash) and press Connect (works with most wallets)

## The Manual Way (if you like pain)

Any EVM wallet should work (we've tested with):

- MetaMask
- Trust Wallet
- Others probably work too, but YMMV ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### MetaMask Setup

1. Hit that "Add Network" button
2. Choose "Add Network Manually" (because we're hackers)
3. Here's the secret sauce:

```bash
Network Name: mo.ai    # yes, that's really the name
RPC URL: https://rpc.moai.ltd
Chain ID: 80418041     # we picked a fun number
Currency: ETH          # keeping it simple
Block Explorer: https://explorer.moai.cash
```

## For the Code Warriors

Using `viem` (the cool way):

```typescript
import { Chain } from "viem";

export const moai: Chain = {
  id: 80418041,
  name: "mo.ai",
  rpcUrls: {
    public: { http: ["https://rpc.moai.cash"] },
    default: { http: ["https://rpc.moai.cash"] },
  },
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: "ETH",
    symbol: "ETH",
    decimals: 18,
  },
};
```

## Troubleshooting

If something breaks (and it might):

1. Double-check the chain ID (80418041 - memorize it!)
2. Make sure you have some ETH (it's test ETH, but we still need it)
3. If all else fails, join our Telegram group and let's figure it out together!
