## Setup Your Lab

First, let's get Foundry going (because we're doing serious experimentation here):

```bash
forge init ai-greeter
cd ai-greeter
```

Tell Foundry where our playground is:

```toml
# foundry.toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

[rpc_endpoints]
moai = "https://rpc.moai.ltd"  # where the magic happens
```

## The Fun Part: Writing Code

Create `src/AIGreeter.sol` - this is where we'll make the AI talk:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@moai/interfaces/IAI.sol";

contract AIGreeter {
    IAI public ai;

    constructor(address _aiAddress) {
        ai = IAI(_aiAddress);  // hook up to our AI precompile
    }

    function greet(string memory name) public view returns (string memory) {
        // using "" for empty system prompt
        return ai.chat("", "Generate a friendly greeting for " + name);
    }
}
```

## Launch It Into The Wild

1. Build that bad boy:

```bash
forge build
```

2. Deploy to our experimental chain:

```bash
forge create -r moai \
  --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  src/AIGreeter.sol:AIGreeter
```

## Let Everyone Know It's Yours

(Verification is flaky, but we'll try anyway)

```bash
forge verify-contract \
  --chain-id 80418041 \
  DEPLOYED_ADDRESS \
  src/AIGreeter.sol:AIGreeter
```

## Play Time!

Let's talk to our AI directly first:

```bash
# Ask the AI about tigers vs bears (yes, really!)
cast call -r https://rpc.moai.ltd \
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000A1A1A1 \
  "chat(string,string)(string)" \
  "is tiger" "is tiger bigger than bear?"
```

Then try your deployed greeter:

```bash
cast call DEPLOYED_ADDRESS "greet(string)" "CryptoFriend" \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.moai.ltd
```
