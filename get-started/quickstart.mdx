## Lab Setup

First, get your environment ready for some blockchain experiments:

1. Node.js v19+ (because we like living on the edge):
```bash
# Using nvm (the hacker way)
nvm install 19
nvm use 19
```

2. Foundry (our weapon of choice):
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

## The Test Network

Here's where our experiment lives:

```bash
# The Vital Stats
Chain ID: 80418041      # Remember this number!
RPC: https://rpc.moai.ltd
Symbol: ETH             # Keeping it simple
Explorer: http://explorer.moai.cash
```

## Getting Test ETH

You'll need some magic internet money to play with. Two ways to get it:

1. Bridge from Optimism testnet: [bridge.moai.ltd](https://f89b4af1.bridge-moai-ltd.pages.dev/)
   (Warning: Actual bridging! Yes, we built that too!)

2. Use our faucet: [faucet.moai.ltd](https://faucet.moai.ltd)
   (Free money! Well, test money...)

## What's Next?

Now that you've got your lab coat on:
- [Hook up your wallet](/get-started/connect-wallet)
- [Deploy your first AI contract](/get-started/deploy-first-contract)
- [Try our wildest experiment yet](/get-started/ai-agent-template)

Remember: This is a testnet. Break things. That's what it's for! ðŸ§ª
