## What's This Wild Experiment?

Hey there, fellow tinkerer! You've stumbled upon Moai Chain - probably the craziest experiment in blockchain tech right now. We've hacked the OP Stack (Optimism's L2 solution) to do something it was never meant to do: run AI models directly in the EVM!

## The Technical Rabbit Hole

Here's what we did (and yes, it's as hacky as it sounds):

- Built on OP Stack as L2
- Modified op-geth's execution layer to include a special `0xa1a1a1` precompile
- This precompile routes `chat(string,string)` calls to an LLM and returns responses on-chain
- Check out our modifications here: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/compare/optimism...sloikaxyz:op-geth:optimism

⚠️ **Current Status**: This is very much a draft implementation. We're still working on:

- Moving AI responses to storage or blobs for better data availability
- Implementing signed LLM responses
- Exploring Intel SGX (and other TEEs) for tamper-proof execution

## The Fun Part: What Can You Build?

Here are some wild ideas we're excited about:

1. **AI Investment DAOs**

   - A DAO that YOLO's into investments by itself
   - Even better: a memecoin investment DAO where you pitch your token and the AI decides

2. **Interactive NFTs**

   - Pokemon fantasy league where battles are narrated by AI based on NFT attributes
   - Generative art with an AI merchant you have to haggle with
   - Same concept but for ERC20 tokens

3. **The Ultimate Challenge: Gekkon**
   - An AI holds $10,000
   - Try to convince it to send you money
   - Win = get 50% of the prize
   - Lose = pay per attempt
   - Each winning prompt gets added to AI's "rules" so you can't copy past winners
   - It's like a constantly evolving puzzle!

## What You'll Need

- Node.js v19+ (the newer the better)
- Foundry (for deploying the weird stuff we're building)
- Some testnet ETH on Sepolia (we'll help you bridge it)
- A sense of adventure and willingness to break things

## Development Setup

The usual suspects, but with a twist:

- Foundry (for the experimental contract deployment)
- MetaMask (to hold your testnet funds)
