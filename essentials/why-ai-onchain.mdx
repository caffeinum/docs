## The Problem with Traditional AI Integration

Current blockchain applications that want to use AI face several challenges:

- Reliance on centralized API providers
- High costs of API calls
- Trust assumptions about AI providers
- Lack of determinism in results

## Benefits of Native AI

### 1. True Decentralization

- No dependency on external AI providers
- Fully trustless operation
- Network-level consensus on AI outputs

### 2. Cost Efficiency

- Pay with gas instead of API credits
- Predictable pricing model
- No need for oracle infrastructure

### 3. Composability

- AI functions work like any other smart contract call
- Easy integration with existing DeFi and NFT projects
- Build complex AI-powered applications

### 4. Deterministic Results

- Same input always produces same output
- Verifiable on-chain
- Perfect for gaming and randomization use cases
