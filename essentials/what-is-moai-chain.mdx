## Overview

Moai Chain is a Layer 2 blockchain built on top of Optimism that brings native AI capabilities directly into smart contracts. It enables developers to create AI-powered decentralized applications without relying on centralized AI providers or oracles.

## Key Features

- **Native AI Integration**: AI functions are available directly in smart contracts
- **Deterministic Results**: Same input always produces the same output
- **Gas-based Pricing**: Pay for AI compute with gas, no API keys needed
- **Optimism Compatibility**: Full EVM compatibility with Optimism
- **Decentralized**: No central AI providers or oracles required

## Architecture

Moai Chain extends the Optimism architecture with:

1. **AI Engine**: Built-in language models and image generation
2. **Precompiles**: Efficient AI operations at the EVM level
3. **Standard Interfaces**: Simple Solidity interfaces for AI functions
